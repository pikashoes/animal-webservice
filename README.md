PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------
Create a webservice with the below requirements using Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, H2 in-memory database, and Spring.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
1/ One to Many relationship using an H2 in-memory database

    Done. I used similar code to what was demonstrated in SportsVans. The relationship
    is between Animals and Breeds.

2/ Have a route defined as /api/ which is a fully functioning web-service serving up JSON corresponding
to the entities in your database.

    Done. All the commands work, and I have set up a separate controller for it. Goes to "localhost:8080/api/"

    I used Postman to check this.

3/ Use Thymeleaf to iterate over a collection on a results page (as seen in SportsVans). You must have at minimum 2 view pages. The use of headers is optionaL.

    Done. I iterated over the collection on a results page.

    Three View Pages:
        1. Home page (welcome image and text)
        2. Results page (list of data)
        3. Random page (generates a random cat picture)

4/ Use Bootstrap to style your pages with menus.

    Done.
